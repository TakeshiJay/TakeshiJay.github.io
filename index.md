### About Me

Hello, my name is Jacob and I am currently a student at California State University Long Beach. My current study is in
computer science and am a first generation university student. The things in life that excite me the most are great food,
discovering new things to learn, and providing help to others where I can. One thing that I take most serious in life is
my learning curves in life. Being inspired to continue to grow and push on is what makes me different than any other person. My whole motto in life is: "__If you are not learning, your are not growing__" which I stand by every day.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TakeshiJay/TakeshiJay.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
